#### What is Spring?

Spring is one of the **most widely used Java EE Frameworks** for building applications. Simply put, the **Spring framework** provides comprehensive infrastructure **support for developing Java applications**.  It aims to **simplify the Java EE development** and **helps developers be more productive at work**. It's **packed** with some **nice features like Dependency Injection and out of the box modules** like:
-   Spring JDBC
-   Spring MVC
-   Spring Security
-   Spring Test

These modules can **drastically reduce the development time** of an application and **writing a lot of boilerplate code**. 

#### What is Spring Boot?

**Spring Boot** is basically an **extension of the Spring framework** which **eliminated the boilerplate configurations required for setting up a Spring application**.  While the Spring framework focuses on providing flexibility to you, **Spring Boot aims to shorten the code length** and **provide you with the easiest way to develop a web application**. With **annotation configuration and default codes**, Spring Boot shortens the time involved in developing an application. It helps create a **stand-alone application with less or almost zero-configuration**.
